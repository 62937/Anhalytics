## Background
There are 3 phases to the project.

### Phase 1:

You have been selected to design and implement a database for a new Corporate Affiliates Program at ESB in University of the Pacific. The program consists of 3 main sections:
1. Career Services
2. Research 
3. Co-op

Your team will be responsible for design of one of the above sections only. You need to gather information on what needs to be stored and submit a detailed and complete ERD.

### Phase 2:
1. Create the database
2. Write the script to insert at least 10 records to the parent tables and 20 records to the children tables. (e.g. 10 companies, 20 projects, .... )

### Phase 3:
You need to propose 3 questions and create the script for them. Your stored procedures need to return both records as well as a customized message. Make sure to incorporate the appropriate checks as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Our team chose Career Service and prepared phase 1 and phase 2 together. For phase 3, my proposed question together with my SQL script is Question #3.
